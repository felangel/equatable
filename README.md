## Overview

Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator as well as `hashCode`.

Not only is it verbose and tedious, but failure to do so can lead to inefficient code which does not behave as we expect.

By default, `==` returns true if two objects are the same instance.

Let's say we have the following class:

```dart
class Person {
  final String name;

  const Person(this.name);
}
```

We can create create instances of `Person` like so:

```dart
void main() {
  final Person bob = Person("Bob");
}
```

Later if we try to compare two instances of `Person` either in our production code or in our tests we will run into a problem.

```dart
print(bob == Person("Bob")); // false
```

For more information about this, you can check out the official [Dart Documentation](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart/design#equality).

In order to be able to compare two instances of `Person` we need to change our class to override `==` and `hashCode` like so:

```dart
class Person {
  final String name;

  const Person(this.name);

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =>
    identical(this, other) ||
    other is Person &&
    runtimeType == other.runtimeType &&
    name == other.name;

  @override
  int get hashCode => name.hashCode;
}
```

Now if we run the following code again:

```dart
print(bob == Person("Bob")); // true
```

it will be able to compare different instances of `Person`.

You can see how this can quickly become a hassle when dealing with complex classes. This is where `Equatable` comes in!

## What does Equatable do?

`Equatable` overrides `==` and `hashCode` for you so you don't have to waste your time writing lots of boilerplate code.

There are other packages that will actually generate the boilerplate for you; however, you still have to run the code generation step which is not ideal.

With `Equatable` there is no code generation needed and we can focus more on writing amazing applications and less on mundane tasks.

## Usage

First, we need to do add `equatable` to the dependencies of the `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  equatable: ^1.2.3
```

Next, we need to install it:

```sh
# Dart
pub get

# Flutter
flutter packages get
```

Lastly, we need to extend `Equatable`

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class Person extends Equatable {
  final String name;

  Person(this.name);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [name];
}
```

When working with json:

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class Person extends Equatable {
  final String name;

  Person(this.name);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [name];

  factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return Person(json['name']);
  }
}
```

We can now compare instances of `Person` just like before without the pain of having to write all of that boilerplate.
**Note:** Equatable is designed to only work with immutable objects so all member variables must be final (This is not just a feature of `Equatable` - [overriding a `hashCode` with a mutable value can break hash-based collections](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/design#avoid-defining-custom-equality-for-mutable-classes)).

Equatable also supports `const` constructors:

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class Person extends Equatable {
  final String name;

  const Person(this.name);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [name];
}
```

### `toString` Implementation

Equatable can implement `toString` method including all the given props. If you want that behaviour, just include the following:

```dart
  @override
  bool get stringify => true;
```

For instance:

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class Person extends Equatable {
  final String name;

  const Person(this.name);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [name];

  @override
  bool get stringify => true;
}
```

For the name `Bob`, the output will be:

`Person(Bob)`

This flag by default is false and `toString` will return just the type:

`Person`

#### EquatableConfig

`stringify` can also be configured globally for all `Equatable` instances via `EquatableConfig`

```dart
EquatableConfig.stringify = true;
```

If `stringify` is overridden for a specific `Equatable` class, then the value of `EquatableConfig.stringify` is ignored.
In other words, the local configuration always takes precedence over the global configuration.

## Recap

### Without Equatable

```dart
class Person {
  final String name;

  const Person(this.name);

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =>
    identical(this, other) ||
    other is Person &&
    runtimeType == other.runtimeType &&
    name == other.name;

  @override
  int get hashCode => name.hashCode;
}
```

### With Equatable

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class Person extends Equatable {
  final String name;

  Person(this.name);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [name];
}
```

## EquatableMixin

Sometimes it isn't possible to extend `Equatable` because your class already has a superclass.
In this case, you can still get the benefits of `Equatable` by using the `EquatableMixin`.

### Usage

Let's say we want to make an `EquatableDateTime` class, we can use `EquatableMixin` like so:

```dart
class EquatableDateTime extends DateTime with EquatableMixin {
  EquatableDateTime(
    int year, [
    int month = 1,
    int day = 1,
    int hour = 0,
    int minute = 0,
    int second = 0,
    int millisecond = 0,
    int microsecond = 0,
  ]) : super(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond);

  @override
  List<Object> get props {
    return [year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond];
  }
}
```

Now if we want to create a subclass of `EquatableDateTime`, we can just override `props`.

```dart
class EquatableDateTimeSubclass extends EquatableDateTime {
  final int century;

  EquatableDateTime(
    this.century,
    int year,[
    int month = 1,
    int day = 1,
    int hour = 0,
    int minute = 0,
    int second = 0,
    int millisecond = 0,
    int microsecond = 0,
  ]) : super(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => super.props..addAll([century]);
}
```

## Performance

You might be wondering what the performance impact will be if you use `Equatable`.
